A short video Android client project based on [Kotlin][1] language imitation "[Open Eyepetizer][2]", using the MVVM architecture implemented by [Jetpack][3] + [Coroutine][30].

## Brief introduction
This is a short video Android client project with a high imitation of "[Open Eyepetizer][2]". Personally, I feel that the UI design style of this app is very beautiful, and the interface is simple and fresh. Through this project, I will learn and integrate related technologies.

There is no complicated encapsulation of the entire project, and the project development specifications refer to [Kotlin official documents][4] and third-party [AndroidStandardDevelop][5]. Personally think that the code is relatively easy to read and understand, so it is also very suitable for novices to get started with the Kotlin language, and at the same time master the use of Jetpack components faster.

It is also worth mentioning that all UIs are measured by the annotation tool, and the font color, size, spacing, etc. are almost **pixel-level** imitated "Open EyeEyeizer" Android client App, corresponding to v6 .3.1 version . ([View historical version][31])
